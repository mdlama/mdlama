I am an [Associate Professor of Biology](https://www.wm.edu/as/biology/index.php) at [William and & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/). My teaching and research are highly interdisciplinary in nature, using techniques and concepts from mathematics, statistics, biology, and computational sciences. Specifically, I teach courses in biostatistics and quantitative biology, and have performed research in quantitative ecology, computational cell biology, and computational neuroscience. 

I am co-PI and Director of Cyberinfrastructure for the [QUBES virtual center](https://qubeshub.org) (Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis). This work has ignited an interest and passion in open source software development, quantitative biology education, and development of education gateways.
